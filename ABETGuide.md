# ABET - How To

If you're teaching a course which is part of an accredited program, you'll need to provide information regarding how each of your course learning objectives (CLOs) was or wasn't met during each term of teaching.  The process can be time-consuming, but with a well-designed course it shouldn't be too onerous.

1. Instructor notified by email at beginning of term.  
This notice gives you a chance to check the database fields for your course, and ensure they line up with your course's CLOs (in the syllabus) and that they're being properly assessed.
2. Course Evaluation Request  
Near the end of the term you'll receive an email which reminds you to file the ABET report.  There will be a link in this email which takes you to the [ABET form page](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/education/abet/index.php).

## Course CLOs

For more information on what CLOs are and how they relate to course organization, please check the [CLO reference page](CLOs.html).  For accreditation terms, each course CLO must be included in the learning materials of the course, and must be assessed at some point during the term.  These assessments are key to filing the ABET end-of-term reports.  If you have no metric for gauging a CLO, you'll be unable to file the report.
