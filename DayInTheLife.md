# A Day in the Life of an Online CS Instructor

This page briefly describes activities to be engaged in as part of fulfilling both your responsibilities as an Instructor and enhancing your course. This document is adapted from the handout by the same name, by Ben Brewster.

## Continuous Student Engagement

Methods include:

- Answering posted student questions.
- Engaging with students on Slack - strike up a conversation in real time, in your course workspace or on the Hub.
- Promptly answering student emails.
- Sharing relevant personal stories - not just in response, but as a new thread of discussion.

It is so easy to fall into the trap of thinking that the students are in a correspondence course or are engaging in a “self-directed tour” of your materials. The goal is not to just “clear the board” and leave Piazza, but to create new engagements with your students, however you can.
*Reflection: How can I show my students that I am here and that I care?

## Correcting Obvious Flaws in Courses

Students will frequently report issues with your course. These range from typos to dead links. Fix these obviously incorrect materials mid-course, as soon as you are able.

## Modifying and Adding New Material

The Course Owner will be in communication with you about writing new assignments and test questions. Normally, the Final needs to be updated at least in part every term. Often, assignments need to be updated so as to reduce the temptation for students to cheat.

Over the course of a term, all faculty engaged with a course should be collecting information about what students struggle with, or topics that could use expansion. These expansions should be added before the students can access that material, so as to not violate the general rule: “do not modify a running course”.

Learning content changes in between formal redevelopments could include the following in consultation with the Course Owner:

- Assignment changes or variations
- Final Exam questions
- How-To videos that show how to use software
- Written content that demonstrates a piece of code or technique
- Links to webpages that could be used as additional references
- Links to articles discussing the course’s learning content in current media

*Reflection: What concept are the students always tripping on in my course?*

## Preparing for Future Redevelopments

Spend time thinking about the next time your course will be redeveloped. Consider the following activities that could be done as you prepare:

- Learn a new programming language or improve your knowledge of an existing one. Seek for opportunities to learn at relevant conferences that OSU may be able to send you to.
- Develop a personal project relevant to your class and show it off to your students.
- Develop a new visualization for your class.
- Create a new simulator or simulation for a concept in your class, e.g. network traffic synchronization or memory access.

*Reflection: What have I always wanted to do in this field, or in this class?*

## Course development (new and old)

If you are the course owner, your course will require redevelopment at least every three years. Depending on your workload, this formal, team-based process could replace one or more classes you would normally teach.

If you have an idea for an elective we could offer (Big Data, OOP, Graphics, program language refresher courses, etc.), suggest it to the Program Director for consideration.

## CE & PD

Your Supervisor and Program Director will help you find relevant and useful professional development and continuous education activities to engage in. These could take the form of conferences you attend, or even courses at OSU.

Keep track of all the things you do - you’ll need this when you write your list of accomplishments for your performance evaluation. Set your vision and goals and work towards them!

## A Night in the Life of an Online CS Teacher

Because of the highly-connected experience of teaching online, be careful to keep a proper and healthy work/life balance. Carefully and clearly inform your students of to your availability. Consider these techniques:

- Don’t work weekends or evenings
- Be careful about answering late-night email, as it may create an expectation on the part of your
students as to your availability. Sometimes you should!
- Use your vacation time to fully disconnect. Have TAs or others organized to assist while you are absent, and get away!
- If you have weekend deadlines, you’ll cause you and your TAs to work on the weekends - if not for grading purposes, then perhaps just for Q&A. Consider Mondays instead!

*Reflection: How can I maintain a healthy work/life balance?*
