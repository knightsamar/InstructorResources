## Standard Resolution Techniques
In general, it is easy to remedy these issues if you have established a rapport with the TA, and are sensitive to any issues they may be going through. See Ben Brewster's Leadership Tips \*\*\*RESOURCE TBDev\*\*\* for help doing this.  Keeping these tips in mind, here are some possible remediation paths.
- Send reminders and Inquire with Empathy   
  In general, when you send a reminder about a pre-determined task, it is easy to cause offense. If you inquire about any lateness with empathy, it is far more likely to generate a positive outcomes.
- Request a meeting to discuss   
  If reminders haven't been doing the job, it's best to sit down face-to-face (or virtually face-to-face) to have a discussion about **why** the tasks aren't being completed.  Once you have established reasoning, it's usually possible to work out a solution.  This may take the form of shifting of responsibilities or deadlines with another TA to find a place where your TA can function at a higher level, or it may just be a place for them to let you know what they're going through and build your relationship with them.

**NOTE:** It is vital that you document this process.  Keep the emails, and write up some notes after any meetings.  

## TA Evaluation
Part of the reason we keep these records is for TA evaluation. for undergrad TAs, having this information will let us track which of our undergrad TAs are performing at a high level.  For GTAs, you'll want to submit this information to Assoc. Head Glencora Borradaile at the end of the term with the GTA evaluation form.  It is possible for GTAs to lose their appointment. For more info on TA evaluation, see the page on [TA Organization](TAOrganization.html).
