# Visual Studio Setup Assignment

## Assignment Purpose

There are a number of different common operating systems the students of this course may use, but all of them need a Windows environment with a functioning, licensed Visual Studio install in order to complete the course assignments. Historically students without existing Windows desktop environments have some difficulty setting up this environment and, as a result, are often delayed in completing Program 1. The purpose of this assignment is to ensure all students have a working Visual Studio setup in the first week of class.
