# Academic Misconduct

## Identification

Identification of Academic Misconduct can be tricky.  Fortunately we have some tools in our toolbox which can assist with this. 


### In Programming Assignments

[moss](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) is a powerful piece of software written at Stanford for detecting similarity in software.  It supports most of the languages we use in our program and can be run from command-line (e.g. on flip by a script) or using one of the GUIs or clients written for it.

It isn't the most user-friendly piece of software, however.  I've written a [moss usage guide](mossGuide.html) which can help you get set up initially to run it by command-line, and understand the results.  After reviewing the results, if you believe there has been a violation of the code of conduct, please check the *Reporting* section of this page.

### In Written Assignments

OSU subscribes to a service called [TurnItIn](https://www.turnitin.com/), which is integrated in Canvas.  It is useful for detecting plagiarism in written assignments.  For help getting started, and for usage, check the [eCampus TurnItIn Resource Page](https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/faculty/resources/turnitin/).
