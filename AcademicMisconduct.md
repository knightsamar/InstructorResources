# Academic Misconduct

## Prevention

One of the best ways to prevent academic misconduct is inform the students specifically what constitutes misconduct in your class.  Your [Class Syllabus](Syllabus.html) should explicitly identify what you will consider to be Academic Misconduct in your class.  A good place to start is referencing Section 4.2 of the [Student Code of Conduct](https://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/sites/studentlife.oregonstate.edu/files/code-of-student-conduct-102218.pdf) in addition to offering specific clarifications on items such as

- Debugging with a classmate
- Viewing another students' code
- Usage of outside resources

The [Academic Misconduct Faculty Page](https://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/academicmisconduct-faculty) has some "Suggested Syllabus Statements" at the bottom of the page which are useful examples.  Even though we don't have a program-wide policy, the students may assume whatever policy was present in their previous class will hold true for yours as well, and this is rarely the case.

OSU Student Life also has some [General Tips](https://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/general-tips) and [Assignment Tips](https://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/final-project-assignment-tips) for prevention of academic dishonesty.

## Identification

Identification of Academic Misconduct can be tricky.  Firstly, please familiarize yourself with Section 4.2 of the [Student Code of Conduct](https://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/sites/studentlife.oregonstate.edu/files/code-of-student-conduct-102218.pdf).  This, combined with whichever specific policies you've outlined in your syllabus, set the boundaries for what will be considered academic misconduct in your course.

One common method of identifying potential academic misconduct is by inspection.  A TA or Instructor may be grading assignments and come across that just seem too similar.  This is perfectly valid.  Remember, our job is only to identify **potential cases** of misconduct and provide evidence.  The *College Hearing Officer* will investigate and interview the student and make a determination of responsibility.  Beyond manual inspection, there are some tools which can make the process of identifying potential misconduct far less onerous...

### Programming Assignments - moss

[moss](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) is a powerful piece of software written at Stanford for detecting similarity in software.  It supports most of the languages we use in our program and can be run from command-line (e.g. on flip by a script) or using one of the GUIs or clients written for it.

It isn't the most user-friendly piece of software, however.  I've written a [moss usage guide](mossGuide.html) which can help you get set up initially to run it by command-line, and understand the results.  After reviewing the results, if you believe there has been a violation of the code of conduct, please check the *Reporting* section of this page.

### Written Assignments - TurnItIn

OSU subscribes to a service called [TurnItIn](https://www.turnitin.com/), which is integrated in Canvas.  It is useful for detecting plagiarism in written assignments.  For help getting started, and for usage, check the [eCampus TurnItIn Resource Page](https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/faculty/resources/turnitin/).

## Reporting

Once you have identified a case where you believe Academic Misconduct has occurred, it is important to submit a report. The Reporting Process is thoroughly detailed [HERE](https://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/academicmisconduct-faculty).  It is a simple procedure and requires fairly little effort on your part. That being said, here are some important notes and tips...

### Filing Tips

- TAs are allowed to help you pull together supporting evidence.
- Check any boxes (Plagiarism, Cheating, Assiting, etc) you think *may* have occurred. The College Hearing Officer will make a final determination.
- The standard penalty set by the College of Engineering is "Penalty on Assignment" (0 points).  
NOTE: Even if you make a suggestion for a greater penalty, the College will not approve it.
- For programming assignments, you should attach all relevant files and/or websites for each submission.  It also helps if you clearly note (in a separate document or in a notes field) the sections of the program that the College Hearing Officer should look at when investigating.
- If you want to make their life even easier, you can remove any obfuscating whitespace students may have used to hide their plagiarism.

### General Notes

- A common method of dealing with the grade while the investigation is in progress is to email the student informing them of the process.  This may include text such as...  
*"...Your assignment is under review for a potential case of academic misconduct.  The College of Engineering Hearing Officer will be in touch soon regarding the incident, and any inquiries should go to them.  Your grade will remain unassigned until the case has been reviewed and a determination has been made by the College Hearing Officer.  For more information on the process, please check the Academic Misconduct Student Resource Page at https://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/academic-misconduct-students"*
- If it's time to submit grades and you haven't received confirmation of Responsibility from the College, we've been advised to give students a grade of I/X where X is the letter grade they would receive if they were found responsible (i.e. they did commit academic misconduct).
- **Assisting** is considered misconduct. This means that if Student A copied Student B with B's knowledge, both of them should have reports filed. *A* for Plagiarism and *B* for Assisting.
- The first confirmed case of Academic Misconduct results in counseling and an assignment penalty. Any later cases can result in removal from the University.
- Because of the above, if you, for whatever reason, are submitting multiple reports on the same student at the same time, the College has asked us to submit only one report and include all violations.  This allows the student a chance to take the counseling and correct their actions.
