# Proctored Exams in the Online CS Program

A number of our courses have exams which are proctored virtually and scheduled through the [Ecampus Exams & Proctoring Form](https://secure.oregonstate.edu/ecampus/proctoring/).  Students may choose their own proctor, which may be an on-site proctor which they may find using the [Ecampus Guide](https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/services/proctoring/finding_proctor.htm) or an online proctor, most likely [ProctorU](https://www.proctoru.com/live-plus-resource-center).

## Best Practices

There are a few things to keep in mind when setting up a proctored exam in Canvas.

### Minimum Open Window  

The OnlineCS Program has determined a bare minimum accessibility window of four days for exams, at least one of which should be on a weekend.  This allows the greatest availaibility for our students, who otherwise may not be able to set aside enough time for a fair attempt.

### Begin and End Exam when you will be Available

Issues happen with proctored exams.  Proctors can receive incorrect information from eCampus, students can misunderstand directions, proctors might misinterpret a rule you've posted, etc..   Because of this, it is important to set the exam to open and close at a time when you will be available.  This way, when a student gets disconnected from Canvas with 20 minutes left in their attempt due to a power outage, just prior to the close of the exam window, you can answer the email/Piazza post/Slack chat/phone call and assist the student right away.  Obviously this type of things might occur at any point in the window, but the majority of incidents will occur near the Begin and End times of the exam.

### Passwords  

- Character Sets for Passwords  
Because some proctoring centers are not exceptionally tech-savvy, it is best practice to avoid special or similar characters and conflicting characters such as 0,O,\<,\>,\#,1,l,I in your password selection.  This helps avoid complicating the connection process for our students.

- Update Passwords  
  It is generally best practice to update the exam password every term.  If you have trouble thinking up new passwords, you can use a password generator such as [this one](https://passwordsgenerator.net/).

## Setting Up a Proctored Exam

### Canvas Exam Setup

Mostly this will be handled by your course designer, but there are a few things to keep in mind as you set up your exam in Canvas.

#### Hiding solutions

If you choose to reveal the exam solutions at a specified date, then when a course is forwarded to another term it should update the date automatically.  However, if you have done this manually in the past, then the setting to "Let Students See Their Quiz Responses" and "Let Students See The Correct Answers" will still be set.  Remember to un-check these boxes at the beginning of the term to avoid giving out answers while the exam is open.

#### Extensions or Early Access

By default, Canvas will assign the same timeframe to every student.  If you want to offer an expanded window to some students, you can do this by editing the Quiz, scrolling down to the Assign tab and clicking "\+Add".  Enter the student's name and the new dates and click "Save". That's it!

#### Retakes, Extra Time on Attempts, and Unlocking a Quiz

If you wish to grant another attempt or additional time to a student, first select the Quiz, then click the "Moderate Quiz" button at the top-right.  Find the student and click the Pencil icon to the far-right of the student's name.  Please note that you cannot add time to a concluded attempt or one in progress.

### Ecampus Exams & Proctoring Form

Generally between terms you'll received a reminder from Ecampus Exams & Proctoring to setup your Proctored Exams at the [Exams & Proctoring Form site](https://secure.oregonstate.edu/ecampus/proctoring/).  After signing in and clicking "**Add an Exam**" you can configure the exam window, time duration, and options.  Clearly these should match whatever you have setup in Canvas and advertised to students, but here are a few additional notes.

- This page defaults to **No Options** and settings do not persist from term to term.
- The "End Date" on this form is the time by which students must **submit** their exam, not **begin** it.  
For example, a 60-minute exam with an End Date time set to 11:55pm will not allow proctors to start an instance of that exam after 10:55pm.
- The "destroyed by proctor" option for Notes is unlikely to actually happen.
- When allowing students to use scratch paper please check the "Whiteboard allowed" option, as this allows ProctorU to verify the student is not keepin their exam scratch work, unless you don't mind students keeping these.

## Common Issues

### Incident Reports

If something out of the ordinary occurs during a proctoring session you will recieve an Incident Report from eCampus.  These are fairly general, but usually happen in the following circumstances.

#### Major Connectivity Loss

If a student's connection drops for a significant amount of time, you may hear about it in an incident report.  Unfortunately, there is a massive grey area in what is considered significant enough to require a report, and your students may have lost time for various reasons without you ever hearing about it, especially if the student doesn't complain to their proctor.  If you do hear about it, there are a number of ways to handle this, and whichever you pick is up to you.

- Full or Partial Exam Retake  
To allow this, add an attempt in Canvas and ensure the student's Assignment window includes enough time for them to reschedule the exam.  You'll also have to notify their proctor.  In general you can message eCampus Testing (ecampustesting@oregonstate.edu) to notify them of the retake and extension, so they can communicate that information to the student's proctor.  If the student's Proctor is ProctorU, you can also directly message them (passwords@proctoru.com) 24/7 to expedite matters.  
NOTE: If you do directly email ProctorU, you should request the grant the additional attempt at no charge to the student.
- Alternate Exam  
This is essentially the same as the first option, but you'll make a separate Canvas Quiz and notify eCampus (or the student's proctor) of the Canvas Quiz name.

#### Suspected Academic Misconduct or Exam Rule Violation

When a proctor suspects academic misconduct, they report it to our eCampus Testing coordinator.  The coordinator will review the case and email you with their thoughts.  It is strongly recommended to request the recorded session so you can review it yourself and make a determination.  If you do believe the student violated the rules of the exam, [Submit a Academic Misconduct report](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?OregonStateUniv&layout_id=6).  You can read more about the student code of conduct [HERE](https://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/academicmisconduct-faculty).

### Life Emergency

Our students are people, just like we are... and just like we do, they sometimes have urgent concerns which override their academic pursuits.  It is our believe as a Program that we should be as accommodating as possible of these unplanned and unexpected emergencies.  Any life-changing circumstance which could not be planned for merits an expanded window of availability for an exam.  If this concerns the Final Exam, consider offering the student an [Incomplete](https://registrar.oregonstate.edu/incomplete-grade-policy) and allowing them to finish the course at a later time.  Please note, however, that Incomplete grades can only be offered if the student is *passing the class at the time of the request*. For more info, see the [Incomplete Grade FAQ](https://registrar.oregonstate.edu/incomplete-grade-faqs-0).
