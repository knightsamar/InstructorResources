# Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA) Recruiting & Rules

As the Online CS Program has grown, the benefit of recruiting teaching assistants from the pool of our own students has become increasingly clear.  If you are teaching a lower-division course these students will be the primary source of your teaching assistants, but there does not yet exist the infrastructure to fully handle the recruiting and hiring process.  For that reason, this burden will fall on individual course Owners and Instructors. If you are teaching a course for the first time, please work with the previous term's instructor and the course owner for assistance in recruiting.

The primary qualities of a successful undergraduate TA are not just subject knowledge but also the level of engagement they provide to the students and the instructors.  The purpose of this document is to outline some time- and resource-efficient methods of recruiting undergraduate teaching assistants for your course, and to assist in guiding these students through the hiring process.

## Undergraduate TA Rules / Clarifications

The work situation of undergraduate TAs is different from graduate TAs. Firstly, undergraduate TAs are strict hourly employees rather than the quasi-salaried status of GTAs.

### Requirements

Undergraduate TAs...

- ...cannot be paid internationally, so any students living internationally are ineligible. International students living in the USA do qualify.
- ...cannot TA graduate courses, ever.
- ...must have taken the course and received a 'B' grade or better.
- ...must complete FERPA training via [MyOSU](https://myosu.oregonstate.edu/web/myosu/employee) prior to engaging in FERPA-associated duties.
- ...are not allowed to evaluate their friends' work, so grading groups must be carefully organized around this.
- ...may work up to 20 hours a week, depending on their time availability.
- ...must *clock in/out* via [EMPCenter](https://mytime.oregonstate.edu).
- ...must have their timesheet approved by their supervisor via [EMPCenter](https://mytime.oregonstate.edu).
- ...will be assigned you or the course owner as their supervisor.

### Additional Administrative Notes

- It is faster to continue the employment of a TA from a previous term than initiate a new hire.
- If a TA will not be working again the next term, their employment should be terminated by the supervisor notifying the UTA guru (Calvin Hughes).

## Piazza Contributors

Within Piazza there is a **Statisics** tool which allows an instructor to analyze contributions, questions, and answers over the course of a term.  Select **Statistics** from the top navigation pane in Piazza and explore this page to see its options.  Some efficient ways of gathering names for potential UTAs...

- Check the **Top Student "Endorsed Answer" Answerers**  
These are the students whose answers the instructors and TAs marked as good.
- Check the **Student Participation Report** and sort by **contributions**. Taking the top contributors and checking how many of their contributions were questions, vs. notes and answers, will provide several potential UTA recruits.

**_NOTE: It is important to verify that, though active, these students were also successful in the course.  A check over their grades and submitted assignments in Canvas is strongly recommended._**

## Slack Top-Posters

Throughout the term your students will be active on both the official course Slack workspace and the student-run [Unofficial Slack](https://osu-cs.slack.com).  You can check the Slack analytics for your course workspace by selecting the dropdown icon next to your Workspace name within Slack and clicking **Analytics**.  You can also go to this page by replacing class-workspace with your workspace ID in the following url: https://class-workspace.slack.com/stats.

Similarly to Piazza **Statistics**, Slack **Analytics** allows sorting by *messages posted* and *days online*.  Extracting a short-list of potential UTAs from these lists is trivial.

**_NOTE: It is important to verify that, though active, these students were also successful in the course.  A check over their grades and submitted assignments in Canvas is strongly recommended._**

## The Undergraduate TA Hiring Process

Once you have gathered a list of potential UTAs from the above or other methods, the students must apply to the Ecampus TA job posting. This posting changes every Academic Year but can be easily found as the EECS Ecampus TA position from [this jobs.oregonstate.edu query](https://jobs.oregonstate.edu/postings/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=Ecampus&query_v0_posted_at_date=&1970%5B%5D=8&query_organizational_tier_3_id%5B%5D=594&225=&commit=Search).  Students applicants must apply to this posting and fill in the associated survey.

From the instructor end, you should notify the UTA Guru ([Sherry Barrett](mailto:sherry.barrett@oregonstate.edu)) your preferred list of UTAs at your earliest opportunity to help expedite the process.
